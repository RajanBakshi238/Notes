### Kubernates:
It is a tool for running a bunch of containers. we give it some configuration to describe how we want our containers to run and interact with each other.

### Kubernates cluster:
A cluster is a set of different virtual machines, it can have one or thousands of virtual machine. All these virtual machine we refer to as **node** .

They all are anaged by something called **master**. It is a program that's going to manage everything inside a cluster, i.e all the different programs which are running, all the different aspects of these virtual machine and etc.   
we are going to tell kubernates to run some program for us, then it will assign it to the one of the rendom nodes.
